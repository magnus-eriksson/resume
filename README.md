# About me
<!--section:[About me]-->

### My background
I'm Magnus. I got hooked on programming in the late 80's. I wrote my first piece of code in Basic on my Commodore 64.

In the early 90's I moved on to an Amiga and hung around on the Demo scene for a few years.

In 2000 I started my professional career as a Flash- and frontend developer (using DHTML, as we called it back then).

Since then I've been using a multitude of languages and technologies like Flash, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP and PHP to build anything from large, integrated back end systems to banners. I've also played around, not professionally, with Python, nodejs, C# (Windows Phone apps) and other things.

Today, my main skill is PHP, which I've been using for 10+ years.

### Philosophy
I firmly believe that there isn't any one technology that fits all and it's our duty as developers to find and use the right tool for the job. Just like a carpenter wouldn't try to cut wood with a hammer.

### The person
I'm an easy going guy with a genuine interest for new technologies and always strive to learn more, even if I'm doing something I've done 100 times before. I know it's a clich√© but it's actually true!

I like making day to day tasks easier for me and my co-workers. It quite often manifests itself in the form of a bash script.
