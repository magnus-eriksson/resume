  "body": "# About me\r\n\r\n\r\n### My background\r\nI'm Magnus. I got hooked on programming in the late 80's. I wrote my first piece of code in Basic on my Commodore 64.\r\n\r\nIn the early 90's I moved on to an Amiga and hung around on the Demo scene for a few years.\r\n\r\nIn 2000 I started my professional career as a Flash- and frontend developer (using DHTML, as we called it back then).\r\n\r\nSince then I've been using a multitude of languages and technologies like Flash, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP and PHP to build anything from large, integrated back end systems to banners. I've also played around, not professionally, with Python, nodejs, C# (Windows Phone apps) and other things.\r\n\r\nToday, my main skill is PHP, which I've been using for 10+ years.\r\n\r\n### Philosophy\r\nI firmly believe that there isn't any one technology that fits all and it's our duty as developers to find and use the right tool for the job. Just like a carpenter wouldn't try to cut wood with a hammer.\r\n\r\n### The person\r\nI'm an easy going guy with a genuine interest for new technologies and always strive to learn more, even if I'm doing something I've done 100 times before. I know it's a clich√© but it's actually true!\r\n\r\nI like making day to day tasks easier for me and my co-workers. It quite often manifests itself in the form of a bash script.\r\n\r\n# Work experience\r\n\r\n__Web developer / System developer @ *Isotop AB*__\r\n\r\n* Building web sites and services\r\n* Maintenance of existing web- and e-commerce sites.\r\n* Integration between systems (REST/SOAP API's)\r\n* Supporting my team, the agency and clients\r\n\r\n__Web developer / Lead system developer @ *River Cresco AB*__\r\n\r\n* Buildning web sites and online campaigns\r\n* Installation, configuration and maintanence of servers (LAMP/LEMP Stack)\r\n* Integration between systems (REST/SOAP API's)\r\n* Social media integration\r\n* Technical support for my team, the agency and clients\r\n\r\n__Web developer / Technical manager @ *Klirr Stockholm AB*__\r\n\r\n* Buildning web sites and online campaigns\r\n* Installation, configuration and maintanence of servers (LAMP/LEMP Stack)\r\n* Integration between systems (REST/SOAP API's)\r\n* Social media integration\r\n* Technical support for my team, the agency and clients\r\n\r\n__Web developer @ *ONE Media*__\r\n\r\n* Buildning web sites, online campaigns and e-mail campaigns\r\n* Integration between systems (REST/SOAP API's)\r\n* Social media integration\r\n* Technical support for my team, the agency and clients\r\n\r\n__Webmaster @ *TDC AB*__\r\n\r\n* Rebuild and maintaining the website and online campaigns for the residential market\r\n* Integration between systems (SOAP API's)\r\n* Design/UX for the new website, designing print material (packaging/guides)\r\n* Helping out the marketing department with various tasks\r\n\r\n__Webmaster @ *UPC Sverige AB*__\r\n\r\n* Maintaining the website and creating online campaigns\r\n* Helping out the marketing department with various tasks\r\n\r\n__Technical customer support @ *UPC Sverige AB*__\r\n\r\n* Technical support to customer for analog- and digital TV (cable TV) and internet\r\n* Training new staff in the above mentioned support fields\r\n\r\n__Customer support @ *Teracom AB*__\r\n\r\n* Technical support to customer for the terrestrial tv- and radion broadcasts\r\n\r\n__Webmaster @ *Magdan & CO*__\r\n\r\n* Rebuild and maintaining the website and online campaigns\r\n\r\n__Multimedia producer @ *Doorways Education AB*__\r\n\r\n* Building e-learning material on CD-ROM and online\r\n* Building online and offline campaings\r\n* Audio and video editing\r\n\r\n\r\n# Skills\r\n\r\n* Installation/maintanance of LAMP/LEMP-stacks\r\n* Version control with git/SVN\r\n* Advanced PHP (10+ years experience)\r\n* Composer for dependency management\r\n* SASS using Nodejs/Grunt tasks\r\n* Setting up Linux servers\r\n* Database design (different RDBMS and NoSQL servers)\r\n* PHP frameworks and applications like Codeigniter, Laravel, Wordpress and more\r\n* Virtualization with VMWare (vSphere & Workstation), Virtualbox, Vagrant\r\n* Intermediate knowledge of Photoshop and Illustrator\r\n* Exerience and an interest in UX and usability\r\n* Understanding of the HTTP Request/Response life cycle\r\n* Interest in hashing methods and entropic security\r\n* Website security like SSL, XSS and CSRF.\r\n* Consuming and serving REST and Soap API's\r\n* Integration with social media like twitter, instagram, facebook and others\r\n* Decent pool and ping pong player\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n[Linked In](https://se.linkedin.com/in/iammange)\r\n",
